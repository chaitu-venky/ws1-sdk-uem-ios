You can create the necessary application profile after you configure the CA and certificate template settings in the Workspace ONE UEM console. This profile is deployed to the app just like an SDK profile.

## Procedure

1. Navigate to Groups & Settings > All Settings > Apps > Settings And Policies > Profiles.
2. Select Add Profile and then choose the Application Profile for iOS.
3. Fill out the General information, make sure to give the profile a name, and then choose Credentials.
4. Select Defined Certificate Authority and then choose the correct Certificate Authority and Certificate Template from the choices provided.
5. Select Save.

## What to do next

Assign the application profile to the application during the upload process.
