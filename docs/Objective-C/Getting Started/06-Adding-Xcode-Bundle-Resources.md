The SDK depends on the following bundle resources to function properly, so add the necessary bundles to your project.

Find some of these bundles inside the AWSDK.framework file structure.

   * SDKLocalization.bundle
   * AWKit.bundle
Important: Add the AWKit.bundle to your project or the application can crash.
