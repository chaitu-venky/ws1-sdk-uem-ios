Geofence settings are configured within an SDK profile. To do so, create an SDK profile or edit an existing one.

A tab labeled Geofencing is visible on the left side of the profile editor. After you select the Enabled check box, enter settings to customize a geofence. A profile containing the geofence settings are obtained through an install profile command.
