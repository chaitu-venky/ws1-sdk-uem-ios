The event analytics function requires enabling analytics in the Workspace ONE UEM console and setting up the DataSampler module to report the analytics.

## Procedure

1. Code the events into your SDK application.
2. Set up the DataSampler module and configure it to report analytics.
3. Enable analytics in the Workspace ONE UEM console.
Use this option to turn analytics on and off so that you do not use excessive bandwidth when you do not need data collected.
You must perform both of these tasks or the application does not collect data and it does not transmit the data to the Workspace ONE UEM console.
   1. Navigate to Groups & Settings > All Settings > Settings & Policies > Settings > Analytics.
   2. Enable the feature.
