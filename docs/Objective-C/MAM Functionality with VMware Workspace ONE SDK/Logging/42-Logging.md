The Logging module of the VMware Workspace ONE SDK allows developers to instrument their applications to discover bugs or any issues when the application is deployed to users.

## Code the Level

You must code the logging level and you must set this option in the Workspace ONE UEM console. This configuration ensures that your network is not burdened with unwanted logging activity.

* SDK Log Types
  
  Workspace ONE UEM displays logs for applications that report application failures and that report application-specific data. These logs integrate with the VMware Workspace ONE SDK so that you can manage applications built by it.
* VMware Workspace ONE SDK Log Levels
  
  Workspace ONE UEM groups logging messages into categories to distinguish critical issues from normal activities.
* Request Application Logs for SDK-Built Apps
  
  Request applications logs for your SDK-built applications from the device record in the console.
* Access Logs and Events for SDK-Built Applications
  
  Access events and logs that the Workspace ONE SDK sends to the console for troubleshooting and management of SDK-built and wrapped apps.
