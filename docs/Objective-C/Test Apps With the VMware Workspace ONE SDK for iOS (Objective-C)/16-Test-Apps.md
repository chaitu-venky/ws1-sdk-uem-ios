The Workspace ONE SDK for iOS (Objective-C) allows you to configure apps dynamically using default settings and application profiles that you can define in the Workspace ONE UEM console and associate to your applications.

* Default Settings for SDK Profiles – Provides settings that you can potentially use across multiple Workspace ONE UEM applications, for example branding schemes, or the type of authentication you want to use on all your applications.
* Application Profiles – Configures an individual application. For example, when you deploy a certificate for use by a particular application.

You can design your application to use as many or as few predefined settings in profiles, to create a flexible application based on your goals.

Test the over-the-air configuration of your app using application and SDK profiles outlined in the following sections.

* Test the SDK-Built App
  Test the integration of your application with the Workspace ONE SDK for iOS (Swift), including the delivery of profiles from the Workspace ONE UEM console to your application.
* Deliver Profiles to SDK Applications
  The Workspace ONE SDK for iOS (Objective-C) allows developers to configure their applications dynamically using SDK and application profiles.
