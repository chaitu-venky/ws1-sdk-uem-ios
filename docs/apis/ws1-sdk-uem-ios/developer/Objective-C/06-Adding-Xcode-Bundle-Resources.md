# Adding the Required Xcode Bundle Resources  
The SDK depends on the following bundle resources to function properly, so add the necessary bundles to your project.

Find some of these bundles inside the AWSDK.framework file structure.

* SDKLocalization.bundle
* AWKit.bundle
Important: Add the AWKit.bundle to your project or the application can crash.
